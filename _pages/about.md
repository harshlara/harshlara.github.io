<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Hi, I’m Harsh Lara — an AI engineer and researcher currently at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). I work at the intersection of language models and practical tool-use, where I’ve led efforts on fine-tuning LLMs for systems like [Project Astra](https://deepmind.google/technologies/project-astra/) and contributed to research on mathematical reasoning and multi-task learning. My work has been presented at NeurIPS, published at NAACL, and has been cited popularly via arXiv.

Before DeepMind, I built ML infrastructure at [Microsoft Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai) and optimized voice recognition systems at [Apple Siri](https://www.apple.com/siri/). I have had the fortune of working with very sharp and talented engineers and scientists during my career - leading to several publications and patents.

I hold a Master’s in Computational Data Science from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) and a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from [NITK Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/). I love computer systems, and I am grateful that my work gives me the opportunity to build technology that creates a positive impact in people's lives.

Outside of work, I’m usually reading something dense but fascinating — philosophy is a favorite, especially when it challenges how we think about human agency and technology. I’m thoughtful by nature, curious about the world, and always up for a conversation that goes off the beaten path. When I’m not working or reading, I’m probably at the gym, or bingeing a new series on Netflix — ideally something that makes me think and laugh.
